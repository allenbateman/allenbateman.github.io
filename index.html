        <div class="content">
            <p>I’m a person with many different interests, my mind is all over the place with details that want to learn. As the very curious person that  I am, I always have the drive to learn new things from different points of view to have a clear understanding of the whole. This always led me to never know what path to choose as a career.</p>
            <p>I’ve never thought that developing video games would involve so many interests that I have. The mathematics and the logic, the creative part to represent ideas and emotions and the capability for creating things for people to enjoy such as I do.</p>  
            <p> For me, video games are the door that opens the path to creating captivating worlds that immerse people in extraordinary adventures.</p>
